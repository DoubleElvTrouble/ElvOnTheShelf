– Before you interact –

I dont like being covered by anyone expect friends, because it might
makes me annoyed and a little mad, u could hide u if u do

If u copied one of my skins, please dni, i dont like being copied
and if u want to inspo its okay, just dont heavy insp to much

I could easily hide someone or they are trying to have a problems with me

If u see me sleeping thats means im afk or spectating

Please dont friend me if we only had 1 interact or two

I dont like it when someone or some stranger sit next to me or my friends
